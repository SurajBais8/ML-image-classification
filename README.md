# P1-Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning-AICTE-Internship

I have done this project to classify images by using CNNmodel and Pre Trained Mobile Net model. I created the streamlit app for the same.
📌 P1 - Image Classification by Machine Learning (AICTE Internship)

This project was developed as part of the AICTE Internship to classify images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Pre-Trained MobileNet Model.
A Streamlit Web App was also created to provide an interactive interface for users to upload and classify images.

🚀 Features

Image Classification using CNN model

Transfer Learning with Pre-trained MobileNet

Streamlit Web App for real-time image upload and prediction

Simple, user-friendly interface

Lightweight and efficient deep learning models

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Streamlit

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

MobileNet (Pre-trained model)

⚙️ Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/P1-Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning-AICTE-Internship.git
cd P1-Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning-AICTE-Internship


2️⃣ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


3️⃣ Run the Streamlit app

streamlit run app.py

📊 Models Used
🔹 CNN Model

Custom Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch.

Trained on dataset for classification tasks.

🔹 MobileNet Model

Pre-trained MobileNet used for Transfer Learning.

Achieved better accuracy with reduced training time.

🎯 Output

Upload an image on the Streamlit app.

The model predicts and displays the class of the image.
